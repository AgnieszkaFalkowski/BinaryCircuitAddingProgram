# BinaryCircuitAddingProgram
This repository contains binary circuit adding program python file, flowchart and user guide

Binary Circuit Adding Program is the final project I made for my intorductory computer science class. 
Since I don't have a lot of experience with object oriented programming at the moment, i decide to implement the whole program with OOP.
To add two binary digits, this program uses the adder circuit with logic gates.

I am quite proud of my project but my goal is to work on it more, and make input and exception handling shorter and more fluid.
